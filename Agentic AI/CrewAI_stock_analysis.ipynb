            " 28 Oct, 2024, 12:24PM ISTMore than the Nifty and Sensex taking a beating, what has been bothering the street and worrying investors is the lack of market breadth these past few days. The risk of the situation getting worse if the indices remain under pressure is high. Also, with valuations still on the higher side, any recovery may take a while. In such a situation, what should bother you more? What happens in the market over the next few days or months? Or how a business is going to pan out? The business, of course. So here are select stocks that depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score which is based on five key pillars – earnings, fundamentals, relative valuation, risk, and price momentum. This implies that there has been a significant improvement in their market outlook in the given time frame.IREDA, RVNL among 12 midcap multibaggers since last Diwali. 10 gems for next Samvat\n",

            " 28 Oct, 2024, 12:24PM ISTMore than the Nifty and Sensex taking a beating, what has been bothering the street and worrying investors is the lack of market breadth these past few days. The risk of the situation getting worse if the indices remain under pressure is high. Also, with valuations still on the higher side, any recovery may take a while. In such a situation, what should bother you more? What happens in the market over the next few days or months? Or how a business is going to pan out? The business, of course. So here are select stocks that depict a strong upward trajectory in their overall average score which is based on five key pillars – earnings, fundamentals, relative valuation, risk, and price momentum. This implies that there has been a significant improvement in their market outlook in the given time frame.IREDA, RVNL among 12 midcap multibaggers since last Diwali. 10 gems for next Samvat\n",
